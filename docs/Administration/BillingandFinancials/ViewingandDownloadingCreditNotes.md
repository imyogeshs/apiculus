# Viewing and Downloading Credit Notes

Like invoices, credit notes are also stored as downloadable and printable _.pdf_ files on the Apiculus management servers on the service provider premises. These can be [downloaded and viewed in the same way as invoices](https://docs.apiculus.com/hc/en-in/articles/13016113944477), and can be accessed from account-level and global credit notes listings.
