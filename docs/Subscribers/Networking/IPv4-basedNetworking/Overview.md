# Overview

IPv4 Addresses form the backbone of networking operations on Apiculus. Internally, IPv4 Addresses is treated as a monetisable Service on Apiculus. However, the use of IPv4 Addresses is implicit as part of other essential Services.

IPv4 Addresses are used:

- For connecting to any Instance created in a Basic/EC network;
- For accessing a VPC virtual router;
- For accessing Kubernetes clusters;
- For accessing the contents of a VPC network.
