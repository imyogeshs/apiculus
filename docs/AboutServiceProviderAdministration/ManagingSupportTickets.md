# Managing Support Tickets

Any request, query or bug report can be raised as a ticket with IndiQus Support via email. This also includes forwarding tickets raised by the end-customers on Apiculus CloudConsole or any other channels permitted by service providers. IndiQus Support never responds directly to end-customer tickets and only acts as L2+ escalation.

IndiQus Support is set up on Zendesk and all service providers will get customer-level access to the Zendesk system for easy tracking of all tickets with IndiQus Support.

:::note
The terms of support and service will be as agreed in the Master Services Agreement signed between each service provider and IndiQus Technologies.
