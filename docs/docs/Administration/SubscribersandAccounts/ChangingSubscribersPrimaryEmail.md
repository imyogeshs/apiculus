Admins can cancel this process by clicking on the _Cancel verification_ link; this will cancel the email change process. They also can resend the verification link by clicking on _Resend link_.

The subscribers need to click the **link** or **Confirm** button they received on the new email ID and enter the **verification code** received in the email.

End-users will be able to login into the platform with the updated email ID and the password.

Once the primary email transfer is completed, an email will be delivered to the new and old addresses.
