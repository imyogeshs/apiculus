# Viewing Invoices

Admins can view all invoices that are generated on the Apiculus system. Apiculus stores invoices as downloadable and printable _.pdf_ files that are stored on the Apiculus management server(s) on the  service provider premises.

Invoices can be downloaded from any invoice list, i.e., at the account level or at the global level.

Invoices contain the following (blocks of) information:

- Invoice details (invoice ID, bill/due dates, payable amount)
- Customer and biller details
- Summary of charges (fixed, usage, total taxes, trial benefits)
- Charges and discount line items
- Trial benefit line items (if any)
- Other static information (e.g., payment details, footnotes etc.)

:::note
Apiculus allows complete customisation of the invoice template according to brand, local and national compliance requirements. For any invoice customisation request, a ticket may be raised to IndiQus Support.
