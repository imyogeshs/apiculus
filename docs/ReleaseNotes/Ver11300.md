## About this Release

This is a major release with just one feature.

## Introducing Regions

[Apiculus®](https://www.apiculus.com) now supports multiple geographically spaced out availability regions as part of a single deployment environment. This essentially translates to apiculus® being able to talk to multiple Apache CloudStack setups behind the scenes. With this, service providers no longer need to be constrained by a single-orchestrator setup, and can have a much wider outlook while defining their cloud strategy.

A detailed note on the benefits of this feature can be found here - [https://www.apiculus.com/blog/manage-geographically-separate-regions-from-a-single-pane-of-glass/](https://www.apiculus.com/blog/manage-geographically-separate-regions-from-a-single-pane-of-glass/)

## What Has Changed?

To incorporate Regions, small changes have been done across the system:

- While signing up, subscribers can choose their 'default' region. This will enable them to choose a region that's closer to them.
- Default regions can also be assigned while creating an account from the administration console.
- Subscribers will need to 'enable' new regions, which can be done while switching between regions in the marketplace.
- Region-wise infrastructure utilisation reports can also be seen on the administration console.
- A lot of other under-the-hood changes have been made for this feature.
