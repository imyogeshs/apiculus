# Linux Instance Operations

From [Operating Linux Instances](https://docs.apiculus.com/hc/en-in/articles/12794520211357), navigate into a Linux Instance and access the **Operations** tab to see all available Instance operations.

Apiculus CloudConsole provides the options to perform common operations on Linux Instances.

- **_Restart Instance_** - Use this option to perform a quick reboot on your Instance. This is a simple restart, and no data will be lost.
- **_Force Stop Instance_**- to forcefully stop a running or a hung Linux Instance.
- **_Reset Password_**- to reset the Linux Instances root user password. _This requires the Linux Instance to be powered off._
- **_Reset SSH Key_** - to (re)set the Linux Instances SSH key association. _This requires the Linux Instance to be powered off._
- **_Rename Instance_** - to rename the Linux Instance.
- _**Migrate Instance**_ - to migrate Linux Instance between VPC networks within the same Availability Zone.
- _**Reinstall Instance**_ - to restore this Instance to its original configuration by reinstalling its Operating System or choosing a new one. _Choosing a new Operating System image may have an additional billing component if it's a priced Operating System._
- **_Delete Instance_** - to delete the Linux Instance. _Please note that deleting a Linux Instance will remove it entirely along with its subscription and is a non-reversible action._
