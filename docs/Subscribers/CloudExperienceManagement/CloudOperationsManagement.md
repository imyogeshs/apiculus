# Cloud/Operations Management
Setting up and managing cloud resources on [Apiculus CloudConsole](https://docs.apiculus.com/hc/en-in/articles/13033685431709) follows a highly intuitive approach that is built on UX principles of modern-day software. The CloudConsole user journeys are simple, visual and information-rich which makes managing cloud resources extremely delightful.

Some rules of thumb while using Apiculus CloudConsole for managing cloud resources are:

- The CloudConsole dashboard is always accessible in one click (by clicking on 'Dashboard' while in the cloud management view, or by 'closing' the [Account Centre](https://docs.apiculus.com/hc/en-in/articles/12844047233693) view) - _this ensures that it's always easy to restart an experience_.
- The experience is split into 2 clear divisions (cloud resource management and account management) - _this ensures complete focus and very low cognitive load as part of the user experience_.
- All available Services are listed on the main navigation bar, and can be accessed in one click from any other section while in the cloud management view - _this ensures ease of access and ease of navigation whenever a sub-experience needs to be restarted. The same philosophy is carried over to the Account Centre where all available sections can be accessed in one click._
- Resource/Service management follows the same UX pattern everywhere and all purchased/provisioned resources can be accessed in the same way, regardless of the Service - _this ensures consistency and predictability in the user experience._
- Custom links that include external knowledge bases, videos and media, and other rich information on how to use Apiculus is always available in the cloud management view. Similarly, commercial information (such as privacy policy, SLA, EULA etc.) is always available in the Account Centre view - _this ensures that information is highly contextual and is strategically provided on the CloudConsole interface._
