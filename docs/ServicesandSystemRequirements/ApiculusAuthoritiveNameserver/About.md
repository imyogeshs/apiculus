# About Apiculus Authoritative Nameserver

Apiculus Authoritative Nameserver (A53) is a DNS management solution built in to the Apiculus stack. A53 uses [PowerDNS](https://www.powerdns.com/) to manage all authoritative DNS operations and also includes [Poweradmin](https://poweradmin.org/) as the administrative and management sub-layer.

:::note
Before enabling A53 on your cloud, note that A53 is only intended to be used as an authoritative server. It is not a lookup system or a recursive DNS server.

The following sections outline the scope of the system:

- [System requirements](SystemRequirements)
- [DNS requirements](DNSRequirements)
- [Types of records supported](SupportedRecordTypes)
