## Creating a Support Ticket

The Apiculus CloudConsole has a ticketing section that can be accessed by clicking on **Support & Tickets** in the main navigation panel of the Account Centre. The tickets section shows a list of all the tickets in your account and lets you filter the view based on ticket priority and ticket status.

Clicking on the **CREATE TICKET** button on the left corner will open up the ticket creation dialog box. Ticket creation also follows the single-form interaction paradigm where all the relevant information is captured intelligently in one place to create the ticket. The ticket creation dialog will show the following options:

- **Ticket Type:** This is a high-level classification in terms of Account, Billing, Technical or another issue.
- **Sub-type:** Based on the ticket type chosen above, you’ll be asked to specify a sub-type for further classification. This is optional but it is recommended that you provide as much information as possible for apiculus’s support agents to be able to diagnose your issue better.
- **Item:** Based on the type and sub-type combination, you’ll be able to pinpoint exactly which item you’re having an issue with. Again, this is optional but it is recommended that you provide as much information as possible for apiculus’s support agents to be able to diagnose your issue better.
- **Ticket Details:** Providing a subject, priority, and message/description are mandatory.
- **Attachment:** Optionally, you can also attach a .png, .jpg, or .pdf file as an attachment. Please note that the size limit on ticket attachments is 5MB.

Creating a ticket will send you a notification email and another email with ticket information that can be used to track and communicate with the support agent(s). Both emails will be received at your email address on record.

## Replying to an Agent

You may reply to the assigned support agent from the ticket interface by using the message box at the bottom of the ticket. Ticket replies also support uploading attachments.

Alternatively, you can reply to the email that you received with the ticket information or the latest reply from the support agent. Email replies will also show up in the ticket details section on apiculus CloudConsole.
