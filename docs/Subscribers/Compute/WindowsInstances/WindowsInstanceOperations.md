# Windows Instance Operations

From [Operating Windows Instances](https://docs.apiculus.com/hc/en-in/articles/13280072414749), navigate into a Windows Instance and access the **Operations** tab to see all available Instance operations.

Apiculus CloudConsole provides the options to perform common operations on Windows Instances.

- **_Restart Instance_** - Use this option to perform a quick reboot on your Instance. This is a simple restart, and no data will be lost.
- **_Force Stop Instance_**- to forcefully stop a running or a hung Windows Instance.
- **_Reset Password_**- to reset the Windows Instances root user password. _This requires the Linux Instance to be powered off._
- **_Rename Instance_** - to rename the Windows Instance.
- _**Migrate Instance**_ - to migrate Windows Instance between VPC networks within the same Availability Zone.
- _**Reinstall Instance**_ - to restore this Instance to its original configuration by reinstalling its Operating System or choosing a new one. _Choosing a new Operating System image may have an additional billing component if it's a priced Operating System._
- **_Delete Instance_** - to delete the Windows Instance. _Please note that deleting a Windows instance will remove it entirely along with its subscription and is a non-reversible action._
