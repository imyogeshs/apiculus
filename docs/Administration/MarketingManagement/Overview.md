# Overview

To cater to the service provider’s marketing needs, service providers can create various promotional strategies as per their requirements. For example, Admins like marketing managers or super admin can create multiple discount codes and coupon codes as a part of the promotion strategy. These can be emailed to the existing customers, new customers, or demo accounts.

The Marketing section provides admins this ability to boost their marketing strategy. Admins can create any number of vouchers that can be redeemed by the subscriber. Various discount codes can be created and distributed among the end customers all depending on the service provider's marketing strategy. This is very handy, fundamental for go-to-market (GTM) strategy, and also can be a key factor for existing customers.
