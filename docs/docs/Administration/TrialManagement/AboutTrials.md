# About Trails

Apiculus offers two ways of managing trial programmes:
- Account trials 
- Subscription trials

Trial programmes are created with duration (days) and benefit (discount %) definitions. All billing amounts generated in the specified _duration_ are applied with the specified _benefit_ when the next invoice is generated.

:::note
Trial benefits for the billing cycle will be shown on the invoice if the subscriber was enrolled in any trial programme.

## Account Trials
[Account trials](WorkingwithAccountTrials) apply to ALL billing amounts generated for an account in the duration of the trial enrollment. The Apiculus billing system automatically takes care of billing records generated for a trial enrollment that spans multiple billing cycles, i.e., months.

## Subscription Trials
[Subscription trials](WorkingwithSubscriptionTrials) apply to ALL billing amounts generated for individual subscriptions in the duration of the trial enrollment. The Apiculus billing system automatically takes care of billing records generated for a trial enrollment that spans multiple billing cycles, i.e., months.
