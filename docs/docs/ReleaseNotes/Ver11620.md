## About this Release

This is a minor release with one new feature along with some fixes across the apiculus® system.

## Free Networks and pfSense - Automated Provisioning and Self-Service

Following up on the availability of pfSense and free networks as a service in version 1.15.0.0, we’ve added cogs and wheels to the nuts and bolts. The service can now be purchased in a fully automated fashion. Admin teams no longer need to perform manual tasks for associating L2 networks on the pfSense interfaces - it’s a push-button, approval-based provisioning user experience.
