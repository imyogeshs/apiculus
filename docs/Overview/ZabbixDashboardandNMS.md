# Zabbix Dashboard and NMS

Service provider NOC teams get restricted access to the Zabbix monitoring system as part of theÂ [service provider administration suite](https://docs.apiculus.com/hc/en-in/articles/13028626149533). Restricted access is provided as any modifications done on the Zabbix system can severely impact the quality of service and experience delivered via Apiculus.

Apiculus uses Zabbix for the following:

- Agent-based monitoring of all guest/customer Instances
- Alert configurations using Apiculus CloudConsole
- System-level alerting for capacity utilisation
- Parametric monitoring of the entire cloud infrastructure
