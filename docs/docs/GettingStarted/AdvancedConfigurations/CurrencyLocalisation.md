# Currency Localisation

All currencies can be localised for display and financial logic, and this can be controlled from Settings > Currencies on the Apiculus admin console. This can help deliver localised experiences based on local and cultural considerations.

:::note
This section does not support adding new currencies. These settings are only for localisation of the currencies that are already set up. If you wish to add more currencies to your cloud setup, you’ll need to get in touch with IndiQus Support.

1. **Currency** - The configured currency
