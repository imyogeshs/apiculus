# Maintaining Relationship Personnel Information

Apiculus CloudConsole makes it easy for users to view information on designated relationship personnel, as specified by the service providers. Using the admin console, service providers can keep this information updated for each subscriber account.

Apiculus allows maintaining primary and secondary personnel details and both can be accessed by navigating into the target account and using the **Relationship Personnel** sub-section.

This information will be visible to subscribers in their Account Centre.
