## About this Release

This is a minor release with some enhancements across the Apiculus system.

## Enhancement: Kubernetes Networking

The Kubernetes service gets a power-up with the networking feature set, making Kubernetes on Apiculus a more robust and complete feature. Apiculus users now have the options to manage firewall rules, port forwarding and load balancing for Kubernetes clusters.

## Refresh: DNS Management

Continuing the user experience that we took to the next level with version 2.0, Apiculus has an entirely new UX for the DNS Management service so that it's simple and intuitive. Service provider admins also get the power of enabling this service as a part of the default service along with the Monthly and OTC pricing modes.

## Other Improvements & Fixes

- Improved the Instance creation backend to ensure better space/host utilisation on CloudStack.
- The limitation of the custom offering for resizing Datadisks has been removed; all the available Datadisk Collections will be listed on the UI.
- Added an option where the service provider can define the custom label for the postal code.
- Fixed a UI bug for the snapshot description.
- Fixed a UI bug while purchasing Windows Instances.
- Fixed a UI bug in the invoice section of the admin console.
