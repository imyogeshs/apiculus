# Configuring Basic Billing

All the various settings related to the billing can be configured here by the service providers. These options are listed in detail below:

1. **Invoice Number Prefix** - All the invoices will be generated with this specified prefix. Changing the prefix here will not apply to the already generated invoices; this will apply to the newer invoices.
2. **Default Credit Limit** - This is the credit limit that will be assigned to all the self-signed up subscriber accounts.
3. **Default Credit Period** - This is the default credit period that will apply to all self-signed up subscriber accounts.
