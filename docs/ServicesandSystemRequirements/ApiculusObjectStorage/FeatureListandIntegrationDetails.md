# Feature List and Integration Details

AS3 is delivered as an integration with Cloudian HyperStore. The integration functions using API-driven checkpoints.

## Standard Integration Touchpoints

- **Account Creation** -  As end-users opt for the AS3, an account is created on the Cloudian Hyperstore. This account allows the user to manage and configure your Cloudian HyperStore deployment, access administrative features, and control various aspects of your storage environment.
- **Cataloguing** - This service will be part of the catalogue, i.e., the service provider configures from where to deliver the service and what price to deliver the service.
- **Usage Reporting -** All the usage is available on the UI; at any point, the user can log in to the Apiculus and view the consumed resources and the associated usage.

## Specific Integration Touchpoints

- **Create Buckets** - Users can create Buckets with unique names following the naming convention mentioned on Apiculus CloudConsole.
- **Add Objects** -  Users can add Objects to their respective Buckets using Apiculus CloudConsole.
- **Manage Service on Cloudian Hyperstore** -  Detailed Object and Bucket management is done via the HyperStore admin panel which can be accessed directly from Apiculus CloudConsole.
