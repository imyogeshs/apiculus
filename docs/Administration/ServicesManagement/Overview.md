# Overview

Service providers can deliver and monetise their cloud services portfolio using Service Catalogues. A 'Service' is defined as any cloud service that is being delivered via the Apiculus solution, and a 'Catalogue' is defined as a price book that subscribers/customers can choose from.

The **Services** section on the Apiculus admin console gives service providers the ability and power to create, define, and set pricing and availability rules for all services in their cloud portfolio. Right from creating Availability zones, naming as per their choice, creating cloud collections, naming these collections, adding various packs and images depending on the type of cloud collection being made and defining all these along with the pricing for the services and also dedicated catalogues can be made for the customer/ customers. In short, administrators or service providers define what to offer, where, and how to offer the services to the end customers. Services are further divided into the following major sections:

- [Availability Zones](WorkingwithAvailabilityZones)
- [Cloud Collections](WorkingwithCloudCollections)
- [Default Services](WorkingwithDefaultServices)
- [Custom Catalogues](WorkingwithCustomCatalogues)
