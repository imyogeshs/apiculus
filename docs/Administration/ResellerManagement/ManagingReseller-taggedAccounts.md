## Creating Reseller-tagged Accounts

### Admin-assisted Tagging

New accounts can be tagged to an existing reseller. When a subscriber account is being created/verified by an admin, all available reseller codes will be shown to the account creator in a dropdown menu.

### Self-signup Tagging

The self-signup form can be used with a reseller code by clicking on the _I have a reseller code_ option on the signup form. This will show an additional text input for specifying a known (and valid) reseller code.
