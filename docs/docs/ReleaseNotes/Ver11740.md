## About this Release

This is a minor release with one new feature along with some fixes and certain enhancements across the apiculus® system.

## New Feature: Account Policies View

apiculus® has introduced the account policies view for subscribers/end-customers. All account policies, including those for payments, KYC, trial management and any other are now visible to the subscriber. A subscriber just needs to click on Account Policies menu item in the user account menu and view all the details.

## pfSense Enhancements

pfSense on apiculus® now has certain flow and UI level enhancements, like displaying of public IP in pfSense VM details and non-availability of LAN/WAN details in case of non-pfSense VM. Also, on unsubscribing the pfSense service, the pfSense VM and LAN/WAN networks will be deleted automatically and public IP will be released, hence the public IP will be available again.

## Other Enhancements and Fixes

- Added a new language Portuguese BR for the Subscriber portal.
- Much smoother UI for a great experience.
- Refreshed icons on both admin and end-user interfaces.
- Optimized and squashed bugs leading to improved speed for both subscriber and administrator portals.
