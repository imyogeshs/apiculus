# About Autoscale
The autoscale feature allows a system to adjust its computing resources based on the changing workload automatically. In virtual machines or instances, autoscaling helps ensure that an application or service has the right amount of resources to handle varying levels of demand efficiently. The key concept behind autoscaling is dynamic resource allocation. When demand for a particular application or service increases, autoscaling automatically adds more computing resources (such as instances or virtual machines) to handle the load. Conversely, during periods of lower demand, autoscaling reduces the number of resources to optimize cost and efficiency.
