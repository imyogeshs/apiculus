# Billing Concepts
Billing on Apiculus Cloud works in a subscription model. In line with modern-day apps and services, subscription billing models are an efficient way to deliver service value as a pay-as-you-go license. This not only eliminates heavy upfront costs for any service purchase, but also gives you the flexibility to cancel at any time and pay for only the amount or duration of use.

## Billing on Apiculus Cloud

To understand the various billing and financial aspects of Apiculus Cloud, it is essential to be aware of certain billing concepts:

- **Billing Cycle:** By default, Apiculus Cloud follows a monthly billing cycle from the 1st to the 31st (or 30th or 28th) of each month. Any resource or service purchased during the billing cycle will be invoiced in the next month.
- **Billing Frequency:** Services can have their own billing or renewal frequencies. This is essentially the time period for which the resource or service is rated and billed for. These can be:
    - Hourly (mainly for virtual machines and disks)
    - Monthly (for most of the available services)
    - Weekly
    - Quarterly
    - Half-yearly
    - Yearly
    - One-time
- **Billing Model:** Apiculus Cloud follows a billing model determined by a credit limit that your account has been offered. This credit limit is a value that you can purchase services and resources up to without running the risk of account restriction, disablement, or termination. Credit limits can be enhanced by Apiculus based on your usage and payment track records.
- **Service Balance:** In simple terms, the service balance is your current purchase capacity on Apiculus Cloud. The service balance includes your credit limit, payments that you have made and all charges that you have incurred on your subscriptions and is denoted using a ‘wallet’ metaphor.

All billing records related to your account on Apiculus Cloud can be accessed from the respective sections under **Financials** in the main navigation panel.
