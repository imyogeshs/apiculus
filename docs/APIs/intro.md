:::note
1. A signature will be generated automatically if you make your API requests from here. If you want to create a signature separately, you can use [this](https://swagger.apiculus.io/signature) script.
2. For async requests, you'll get a job-id as the result, which you'll need to pass to the queryAsyncJobResult API.
