# Enabling or Disabling Catalogue Items

[Default Services](WorkingwithDefaultServices) and [Custom Catalogues](WorkingwithCustomCatalogues) both offer the ability to enable or disable item availability. This works at three levels:

1. **Item level** - any item (Collection Item or standalone item) can be toggled by using the switch on the right on the chosen row.
2. **Collection level** - all Collections in a Service can be toggled by using the switch to the right of  the Collection name.
3. **Service level** - Services in a Custom Catalogue can be toggled by using the switch to the right of the Service title. Services in the Default Services catalogue can be toggled by using the switch on the top of the section.

:::note
All changes need to be **published** in order to reflect on the Apiculus CloudConsole. If a customer is on a resource creation/purchase page at the time of publishing these edits, their purchase will fail.
