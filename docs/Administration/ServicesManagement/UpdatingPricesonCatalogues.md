# Updating Prices on Catalogues

Pricing on [Custom Catalogues](WorkingwithCustomCatalogues) can be edited at three levels:

- **Item level** - any item (Collection Item or standalone item) can have custom prices defined by entering the amount in the _price_ text input. Depending on the Service, the available billing models  (e.g., /hr, /mo etc.) will be displayed.  This option is available for [Default Services](WorkingwithDefaultServices) as well.
-  **Collection level** - all Collections in a catalogue have an option to 'bulk-update' prices for all Collection Items in that Collection by specifying a multiplier (< 1 for deflation and > 1 for inflation).
- **Service level** - all Services in a catalogue have an option to 'bulk-update' prices for that Service by specifying a multiplier (< 1 for deflation and > 1 for inflation).

:::note
All changes need to be **published** in order to reflect on the Apiculus CloudConsole. If a customer is on a resource creation/purchase page at the time of publishing these edits, their purchase will fail.
