# Payments
Apiculus Cloud supports three ways of making payments or adding money to the wallet:

- **Payment Gateway -** Apiculus Cloud supports receiving direct online payments (via 3rd party payment gateways). Using this feature, you can specify the amount and also distribute the amount against outstanding invoices or settle it as advance amounts.
- **Cash Voucher -** Time and again, you may receive cash vouchers/coupons as part of a marketing campaign or for any other reason. The service balance can be topped up using cash vouchers by entering the coupon code as received from Apiculus.
- **Offline Payments -** In the event that an online payment failed to get recorded, or if you wish to pay offline (using a cheque, direct bank transfer, or any other payment method), the Apiculus admin will record it as an offline settlement from the backend administration console within 48-72 hours of receiving the payment. This will get reflected as a transaction in your account.
