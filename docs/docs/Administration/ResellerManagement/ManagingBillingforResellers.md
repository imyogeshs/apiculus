# Managing Billing for Resellers

Even with the Reseller module enabled and customers getting acquired via resellers, there is no impact on billing and availability of Services to the subscribers/customers. The points to consider here are:

- All customers (reseller-tagged and otherwise) will see available Services based on the Catalogue assigned to each one of them.
- Invoice will be generated with the service provider as the biller (not the reseller), with charges and amounts as what is published in the Catalogues associated with the customers.
- Resellers can only log in and view the account details of customers who they have onboarded with their reseller codes.
- Resellers have no visibility into or control over available Services, their prices, billing, invoicing or any other customer account-level actions. **Resellers are simply treated as acquisition partners and not servicing partners**.

## Receiving Payments from Reseller-tagged Accounts

Once an invoice is generated, payments can be received from the customers in the following ways:

1. Making a payment against an invoice from **Account Centre > Invoices and Credit Notes** on Apiculus CloudConsole; _self-service, initiated by customer, executed via payment gateway_
2. Making a 'bulk' payment from **Account Centre > Wallet and Transactions** on Apiculus CloudConsole; _self-service, initiated by customer, executed via payment gateway_
3. Recording an offline transaction from the account-level or global **Transactions** section on Apiculus admin console; _admin-assisted, initiated by admin, recorded manually_

## Settling Bills with Resellers

Billing between service provider and reseller needs to be handled offline and Apiculus maintains and presents all the information needed to achieve this as part of the reseller life cycle. The Metabase business intelligence and dashboard system offers a **Reseller Management** dashboard which shows all the required information as reports and widgets. Some of the standard reports delivered via Metabase are:

- Total reseller-driven sales
- Non-reseller sales
- Reseller payout reports
- Customers acquired via resellers

The above information can be used to generate the relevant invoices to resellers and payments can be sent offline.

For any other report requirements, a ticket may be created with IndiQus Support.
