# Overview

The Apiculus Load Balancer Instances (LBI) Service allows CloudConsole users to create load balancer appliances, which are Linux Instances pre-loaded with a [Citrix NetScaler VPX](https://www.netscaler.com/platform/vpx-virtual-machine) image. LBI can be used with VPC networks to [achieve various traffic management features](https://docs.apiculus.com/hc/en-in/articles/13107360073501) that are not possible using the standard VPC-based load balancing.

The following management features are supported on Apiculus CloudConsole:

- [Creating LBI inside a VPC](https://docs.apiculus.com/hc/en-in/articles/13261735201437)
- [Accessing the NetScaler VPX control panel](https://docs.apiculus.com/hc/en-in/articles/13261912336925)

_**Note** - Apiculus LBI is an experimental feature._
