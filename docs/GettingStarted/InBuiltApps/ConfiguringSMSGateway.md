# Configuring SMS Gateway

The SMS gateway is an in-built Apiculus application that enables messages and notifications to be sent to end customers via SMS. Credentials of the enabled SMS gateway can be maintained by navigating to **Settings > Marketing & Communications > SMS** from the user menu on the top right of the Apiculus admin console.
