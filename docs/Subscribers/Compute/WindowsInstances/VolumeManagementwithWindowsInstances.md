# Volume Management with Windows Instances

From [Operating Windows Instances](AboutWindowsInstances), navigate into a Windows Instance and access the **Volumes** tab to see the disks attached to this Instance.

Windows Instances on Apiculus work with the [Block Volumes Service](/docs/Subscribers/Storage/BlockVolumes/AboutBlockVolumes) and let you carry out basic disk operations.

There are three quick actions available i.e.,

1. **Create Template** - Click on it, and enter the image name and description.
2. **Create Snapshot** - Clicking on this will create a Volume snapshot.
3. **Detach/attach** - This will attach/detach the volume to/from the instance.

:::note
Volume-level operations are available as part of the Block Volumes Service.
