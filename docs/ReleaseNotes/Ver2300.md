## About Release

This is a major release with a new feature and enhancements across the ApiculusÂ® system.

## New Feature: Apiculus Backup Service

Apiculus now offers the **Apiculus Backup Service** integrated with **Acronis**. Service provider administrators can quickly configure and set prices via the admin portal. End-users can effortlessly take backups and recoveries with automated protection that activates upon instance creation or opt for the service manually post-instance creation. Additionally, users benefit from built-in cybersecurity features and can configure advanced protection settings through the Acronis Cyber Protect dashboard.
